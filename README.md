# Python-Project
Welcome to the classic game of Snake, Water, Gun implemented in Python! This simple yet engaging project allows players to test their strategic thinking in a fun and quick game. The rules are straightforward:

    Snake vs. Water: Snake wins as it can crawl into the water and swim.
    Water vs. Gun: Water wins by extinguishing the fire from the gun.
    Gun vs. Snake: Gun wins by shooting the snake.

Players make their choice, and the computer randomly selects its move. The winner is then determined based on the game rules. The project not only provides entertainment but also serves as a great introduction to basic Python programming concepts, including conditional statements and randomization. Enjoy the challenge and see if you can outsmart the computer in this classic game!
